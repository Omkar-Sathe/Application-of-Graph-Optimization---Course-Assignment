# Application of Graph Optimization Course Assignment
# Project Description
The research problem at hand revolves around the optimization of the University Course Assignment System. Within a department, there are "n" faculty members categorized into three distinct groups: "x1," "x2," and "x3." Faculty in each category is assigned different course loads, with "x1" handling 0.5 courses per semester, "x2" taking 1 course per semester, and "x3" managing 1.5 courses per semester.

The primary objective is to develop an assignment scheme that maximizes the number of courses assigned to faculty while aligning with their preferences and the category-based constraints ("x1," "x2," "x3"). The challenge lies in ensuring that a course can only be assigned to a faculty member if it is present in their preference list.

This problem is unique due to the flexibility it offers regarding the number of courses faculty members can take, distinct from typical Assignment problems.

# Installation
No installation is required as it is a project for a course. Simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the report.

# Usage
To solve the problem at hand, execute the provided Java code. The CSV file "simple_test.csv" contains the necessary data for the assignment problem. Ensure the CSV file follows the specified format.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! You can contribute by adding more real-life constraints to enhance the problem model.  Potential modifications may include adjusting the maximum number of courses "y" for each category of professors, instead of requiring exact adherence, or extending the number of professor categories beyond the existing three to devise a more generalized solution. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

@professor and @TA's the video file will need to be downloaded using the download raw file option to view it
as github did not allow it to be displayed here directly due to the video's size.

We have organized the video into three main sections
1) an introduction to the problem and our broad approach to tackle it.
2) an explanation of some of the key aspects in the code.
3) a live demo of running the code on various testcases and analyzing the output generated.
